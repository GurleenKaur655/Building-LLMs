# Building-LLMs
Learning how LLMs work and how can I build one

I have always been intrigued by the idea of how Chat GPT works, and if it's possible for a person like me just coding at home to build one. Practically, I dont have enough money to actually fund the process of building a model like chat gpt with billions and trillions of parameters, but trying to put together pieces at a small scale to build a working model also doesn't sound bad to me! And learning to fine-tune it for specific purpose. 

So, I am documenting my journey here!
